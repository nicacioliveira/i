Hi, I'm Nicácio Oliveira, a Software Engineer from Serra Branca, Paraíba (Brazil). I graduated in Computer Science from the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG). My journey into software engineering began in 2018, though my relationship with computers started much earlier - alongside my first passion, music, which has now become a cherished hobby.

I'm deeply passionate about cloud computing, Node.js, Go, distributed systems, and the art of automation. My approach to engineering challenges is language-agnostic - I believe in choosing the right tool for each specific problem.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicacioliveira/).

## Professional Journey

Currently, I work as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at VTEX, where I'm part of the Observability team. Here, I manage a modern observability stack that handles massive amounts of telemetry data daily: over 200 billion tracing spans (with continuous growth as we scale), billions of time series metrics, and logs. This telemetry is generated from our platform that processes more than 100 million requests per minute on a daily basis. I'm actively involved in developing SLO frameworks and managing large-scale Kubernetes clusters to support this extensive observability infrastructure.

I'm also proud to be involved with VTEXLab, a partnership between VTEX and my alma mater, UFCG. As a mentor, I guide students through real-world engineering challenges, helping bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry practices. This role allows me to give back to the university community while fostering the next generation of software engineers.

Before VTEX, I worked at Scale Systems, where I developed a full-stack platform for UOL's Cineclick portal, and at Incodde, where I contributed to various projects ranging from payment systems to marketing platforms. Each role has added unique perspectives to my understanding of scalable, reliable systems.

## Current Focus

My current passion lies in Site Reliability Engineering and Observability. I enjoy tackling complex engineering challenges and building systems that operate reliably at scale. I'm particularly interested in:

- Cloud Native Technologies
- Distributed Systems
- OpenTelemetry
- Kubernetes
- Go & Node.js
- Infrastructure as Code
- Databases like: ClickHouse, VictoriaMetrics, etc.
- SRE Foundations: SLIs and SLOs
